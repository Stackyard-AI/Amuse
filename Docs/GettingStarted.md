#### Cache Mode

The "Cache Mode" setting allows you to control how models are loaded and managed within the application. Choose between "Single" and "Multiple" options from the drop-down menu.

##### Single:

Selecting "Single" restricts the application to load only one model at a time. If you load another model, it will automatically unload the previously loaded one. This setting is ideal when working with one model at a time and requires a sequential model loading approach.

##### Multiple:

Opting for "Multiple" enables concurrent loading of multiple models, significantly improving the efficiency of switching between them. However, it's important to note that loading too many models simultaneously may surpass the hardware limitations of the user's system. In this mode, users are responsible for manually unloading models to avoid exceeding hardware constraints. Exercise caution and awareness to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.

#### Auto-Save Images
Enable this option to automatically save images generated by the application.

#### Auto-Save Blueprints
Enable this option to automatically save blueprints for the generated images. This can only be enabled if "Auto-Save Images" is also enabled.

#### Auto-Save Directory
If "Auto-Save Images" is enabled, specify the auto-save directory where generated images and blueprints will be saved. You can either manually type the desired directory into the text box or use the "Browse" button to navigate to the desired directory in the explorer.

#### Cache Mode
The "Cache Mode" setting allows you to control how models are loaded and managed within the application. Choose between "Single" and "Multiple" options from the drop-down menu.

##### Single:
Selecting "Single" restricts the application to load only one model at a time. If you load another model, it will automatically unload the previously loaded one. This setting is ideal when working with one model at a time and requires a sequential model loading approach.

##### Multiple:
Opting for "Multiple" enables concurrent loading of multiple models, significantly improving the efficiency of switching between them. However, it's important to note that loading too many models simultaneously may surpass the hardware limitations of the user's system. In this mode, users are responsible for manually unloading models to avoid exceeding hardware constraints. Exercise caution and awareness to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.

### Prompt
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/aad4144d-86b0-4a12-bffa-f9ad21da533b)

A prompt serves as a specific instruction or input provided to guide the diffusion process. It influences the way information or signals spread across a stable diffusion system, shaping the direction and nature of the diffusion. The prompt plays a crucial role in determining the outcome or behavior of the diffusion process within the stable diffusion system.

### Negative Prompt
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/317d20ce-6e07-4b04-bd2f-70ab095a0c07)

A negative prompt serves as a specific input or instruction to inhibit or constrain the diffusion process. Instead of guiding the spread of information or signals, negative prompts restrict or counteract certain aspects, influencing the system in a way that opposes or limits the usual diffusion dynamics. These prompts play a critical role in shaping the outcome by introducing constraints or inhibitory factors into the stable diffusion process.

### Scheduler Options
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/b5387af7-a542-4f83-859b-d1f4e067cc4b)

There are several options that impact the resulting images generated.

#### Scheduler
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/d7297246-afca-4f2a-aeac-73691780fd0e)

A scheduler is responsible for managing and controlling the timing and order of events or processes. It determines when and in what sequence various tasks or actions should occur within the system. The scheduler plays a crucial role in coordinating the execution of different elements, ensuring a well-organized and efficient operation of the overall system. It helps optimize resource utilization, prioritize tasks, and maintain stability in the diffusion process by controlling the timing and sequence of events. The available schedulers will vary depending on the model being used.

#### Seed
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/c1726c03-2bde-40bd-9213-4b695c19c789)

A seed is a starting point for generating random numbers. The seed is an initial value that serves as the input for a random number generator algorithm. When you use the same seed in different simulations or runs, you ensure that the random numbers generated are reproducible. Using a seed of 0 will result in a random seed each time.

![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/4f52b280-d42b-4731-9db3-f868187612a1) This button will choose a seed at random.

![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/69fb8765-487e-40b3-906d-14c2165d2ab3) This button will change the seed back to 0.

#### Inference Steps
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/bee8bcf9-158d-4f1c-a8c0-19dc31a80f50)

The number of inference steps plays a crucial role in the quality and diversity of the generated samples. Increasing the number of inference steps generally allows the model to capture more complex dependencies in the data and generate more realistic samples. However, this comes at the cost of increased computational time and resources.

#### Beta Schedule
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/8a3222fc-5f9f-408e-9e77-9f5890e2da20)

The beta schedule is a strategy for dynamically adjusting the value of the beta hyperparameter during the training of generative models. It is employed to strike a balance between faithful reconstruction of input data and regularization of the latent space representation.

#### Live Update
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/dd3cbbf8-72eb-4bd5-ad2c-1639bf0f2aea)

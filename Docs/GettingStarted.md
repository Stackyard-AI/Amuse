### Model Settings

#### Cache Mode

The "Cache Mode" setting allows you to control how models are loaded and managed within the application. Choose between "Single" and "Multiple" options from the drop-down menu.

##### Single:

Selecting "Single" restricts the application to load only one model at a time. If you load another model, it will automatically unload the previously loaded one. This setting is ideal when working with one model at a time and requires a sequential model loading approach.

##### Multiple:

Opting for "Multiple" enables concurrent loading of multiple models, significantly improving the efficiency of switching between them. However, it's important to note that loading too many models simultaneously may surpass the hardware limitations of the user's system. In this mode, users are responsible for manually unloading models to avoid exceeding hardware constraints. Exercise caution and awareness to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.

#### Auto-Save Images
Enable this option to automatically save images generated by the application.

#### Auto-Save Blueprints
Enable this option to automatically save blueprints for the generated images. This can only be enabled if "Auto-Save Images" is also enabled.

#### Auto-Save Directory
If "Auto-Save Images" is enabled, specify the auto-save directory where generated images and blueprints will be saved. You can either manually type the desired directory into the text box or use the "Browse" button to navigate to the desired directory in the explorer.

### Execution Defaults

#### Provider
Select the preferred device for execution from the available options.

#### Mode
Choose between ORT_Sequential and ORT_Parallel. ORT_Sequential processes operations sequentially, while ORT_Parallel allows for simultaneous processing of multiple operations. The choice can impact the speed and efficiency of model inference based on the model characteristics and hardware.

#### DeviceId
Enter the ID of the desired device for execution. Set to 0 for automatic selection.

#### InterOp Threads
Set the number of InterOp threads responsible for managing parallel execution of the graph across nodes. This is an advanced setting rarely needing adjustment.

#### IntraOp Threads
Set the number of IntraOp threads, a more granular setting across devices for parallel execution. This is an advanced setting rarely needing adjustment.

**Note:** These default settings apply only to new models during installation. Changing these settings will not impact already installed models. To modify these settings for existing models, adjustments must be made in the individual model settings.

#### Save Changes
Click the "Save Changes" button to save any modifications made to the settings. This ensures that the updated configurations are applied and retained for future use.

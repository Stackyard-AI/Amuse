### Model Settings

#### Cache Mode
The "Cache Mode" setting allows you to control how models are loaded and managed within the application. Choose between "Single" and "Multiple" options from the drop-down menu.

##### Single:
Selecting "Single" restricts the application to load only one model at a time. If you load another model, it will automatically unload the previously loaded one. This setting is ideal when working with one model at a time and requires a sequential model loading approach.

##### Multiple:
Opting for "Multiple" enables concurrent loading of multiple models, significantly improving the efficiency of switching between them. However, it's important to note that loading too many models simultaneously may surpass the hardware limitations of the user's system. In this mode, users are responsible for manually unloading models to avoid exceeding hardware constraints. Exercise caution and awareness to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.

#### Auto-Save Images
Enable this option to automatically save images generated by the application.

#### Auto-Save Blueprints
Enable this option to automatically save blueprints for the generated images. This can only be enabled if "Auto-Save Images" is also enabled.

#### Auto-Save Directory
If "Auto-Save Images" is enabled, specify the auto-save directory where generated images and blueprints will be saved. You can either manually type the desired directory into the text box or use the "Browse" button to navigate to the desired directory in the explorer.

#### Realtime Refresh Rate (ms)
Set the refresh rate (in milliseconds) when "Live Update" is enabled during image generation.

##### Enable History
Enable this option to show all Live Update changes in the history. Note that "Live Update" generates many images and enabling history may result in cluttering the history with frequent updates.

### Execution Defaults

#### Provider
Select the preferred device for execution from the available options.

#### Mode
Choose between ORT_Sequential and ORT_Parallel. ORT_Sequential processes operations sequentially, while ORT_Parallel allows for simultaneous processing of multiple operations. The choice can impact the speed and efficiency of model inference based on the model characteristics and hardware.

#### DeviceId
Enter the ID of the desired device for execution. Set to 0 for automatic selection.

#### InterOp Threads
Set the number of InterOp threads responsible for managing parallel execution of the graph across nodes. This is an advanced setting rarely needing adjustment.

#### IntraOp Threads
Set the number of IntraOp threads, a more granular setting across devices for parallel execution. This is an advanced setting rarely needing adjustment.

**Note:** These default settings apply only to new models during installation. Changing these settings will not impact already installed models. To modify these settings for existing models, adjustments must be made in the individual model settings.

The "Models" page serves as the central hub for managing the various models within the application. Users can download specific models or use templates to install predefined types of models. This page provides a convenient interface for users to access, organize, and install the models they need for various tasks.

## Install/Download Model

### Models and Model Templates

The models featured on the Models page constitute a curated selection of pre-configured models that have undergone thorough testing with Amuse, ensuring their reliable performance. These models are known to work seamlessly within the application.

#### Model Templates
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/538b0bc9-2309-4849-a8f3-def8684ec795)

In addition to individual models, the Models page includes Model Templates. These templates are pre-configured for various model types, offering a convenient way to install other downloaded models. Each Model Template is carefully designed to simplify the installation process and enhance the user experience.

### Install Model

If you have already downloaded one of the models prepopulated in the models page, this button will let you point to the directory you have that model in to install it.

This button will let you choose where to save the model and then download and install it. This button will only download the files needed to run Amuse and ignore everything else, which allows for a faster download in many cases.

#### Clone Model Repository

his button will let you choose where to save the model and then download and install it. This button downloads every file in the model repository including files Amuse does not need to be able to run, which can result in longer download times in many cases.

### Prompt
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/aad4144d-86b0-4a12-bffa-f9ad21da533b)

A prompt serves as a specific instruction or input provided to guide the diffusion process. It influences the way information or signals spread across a stable diffusion system, shaping the direction and nature of the diffusion. The prompt plays a crucial role in determining the outcome or behavior of the diffusion process within the stable diffusion system.

### Negative Prompt
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/317d20ce-6e07-4b04-bd2f-70ab095a0c07)

A negative prompt serves as a specific input or instruction to inhibit or constrain the diffusion process. Instead of guiding the spread of information or signals, negative prompts restrict or counteract certain aspects, influencing the system in a way that opposes or limits the usual diffusion dynamics. These prompts play a critical role in shaping the outcome by introducing constraints or inhibitory factors into the stable diffusion process.

### Scheduler Options
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/b5387af7-a542-4f83-859b-d1f4e067cc4b)

There are several options that impact the resulting images generated.

#### Scheduler
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/d7297246-afca-4f2a-aeac-73691780fd0e)

A scheduler is responsible for managing and controlling the timing and order of events or processes. It determines when and in what sequence various tasks or actions should occur within the system. The scheduler plays a crucial role in coordinating the execution of different elements, ensuring a well-organized and efficient operation of the overall system. It helps optimize resource utilization, prioritize tasks, and maintain stability in the diffusion process by controlling the timing and sequence of events. The available schedulers will vary depending on the model being used.

#### Live Update
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/dd3cbbf8-72eb-4bd5-ad2c-1639bf0f2aea)

Enabling Live Update will cause images to be constantly generated in real time as changes to the settings are made, otherwise images will only be generated one at a time when the Generate button is clicked manually.

#### Seed
![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/c1726c03-2bde-40bd-9213-4b695c19c789)

A seed is a starting point for generating random numbers. The seed is an initial value that serves as the input for a random number generator algorithm. When you use the same seed in different simulations or runs, you ensure that the random numbers generated are reproducible. Using a seed of 0 will result in a random seed each time.

![image](https://github.com/Stackyard-AI/Amuse/assets/90013272/69fb8765-487e-40b3-906d-14c2165d2ab3) This button will change the seed back to 0.
